                    <p>Time flies - more than a month has passed since <a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org/">BCHN</a> v0.21.0 was released, and a little over two weeks since <a href="https://read.cash/@freetrader/bchn-lead-maintainer-report-2020-03-14-84f2992d">my last report</a>.
                        Since then the COVID-19 pandemic has touched us all in different ways, but I hope everyone is taking the necessary precautions, staying as safe and healthy as possible and helping others do the same.</p>
                    <p>I'd like to make these maintainer reports a bi-monthly occurrence. If we get much busier with developments in the coming weeks, I might only have time for a monthly report myself, with other reports (e.g. BCHN financial statements)
                        possibly being done separately.</p>

                    <p>Blockchain <a href="https://bitcoincash.network/voting/">signaling</a> for BCHN decreased -</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>SBI crypto mining on BCH seems to have dropped away to almost nothing, losing us some support. I do not know the precise reason for this removal of hashrate by the pool, but they contributed a fair amount to signaling for our
                                project. I thank them for their past support and hope they can come back. If they do have feedback for our project, contact me!
                                <br>(<em>Update 2 April: I've heard now, inofficially, that allegedly the drop-off from SBI is due to testing of their pool, and that the intention is to continue signaling for BCHN - this seems good news and we hope they return!</em>)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>We lost some signaling from ASICseer pool, who stopped their pool project. They gave me an official statement on the reason:
                                <br><em>"ASICseer remains a strong supporter of the BCHN project. However, ASICseer has terminated its pool project due to the broken BCH DAA. The current version of the algorithm allows BTC mining pools to exploit periods of low difficulty by bringing exahashes of foreign hashrate onto the BCH chain, leaving all other honest pools at a competitive disadvantage."</em>
                                <br>(note: "foreign" here is not talking about nationality, it refers to hashrate which does not originate from miners who care about BCH)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bitcoin.com pool is still signaling support for BCHN. Thank you <a href="https://bitcoin.com/">Bitcoin.com</a> for your continued support.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Due to the above, the amount of blocks signaling for us has dropped from a high of ~12.5% of BCH blocks in this last 2-week period, to about ~ 5.5% over last 1000 blocks, per <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/blocks"><a href="https://cash.coin.dance/blocks">https://cash.coin.dance/blocks</a></a>at
                        time of writing.</p>
                    <p>Our <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/nodes/bchn">listening node levels have risen from 42 to 55</a> over this time period. This figure does not cover all nodes, since some node operators do not open incoming connections to their nodes.</p>

                    <p>Since last report, the project has received funds through its multi-signature donation address <a href="https://read.cash/@freetrader/bchn-lead-maintainer-report-2020-03-14-84f2992d#bad-link">bitcoincash:prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk</a> .
                        <br>However, we are on the verge of participating in the Flipstarter node crowd-funding campaign, which may see the addition of further funding addresses earmarked for specific tasks which will be outlined in our funding proposal.</p>
                    <p>As of today (block <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/628882">628882</a>), our public wallet, which holds all our funds at the above address, contains <strong>a balance of 143.23690617 BCH</strong>, which represents a <strong>net increase of 2.18412567 BCH</strong> from
                        last time.</p>
                    <p>There were <strong>three payments made</strong> from our multisig wallet during this last period:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>2020-03-18: -0.26542268 BCH for two article translations to Chinese (the previous maintainer report, and our 'May 2020 and beyond' plans)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>2020-03-18: -0.0000048 BCH due to a wallet configuration mistake, the change from the preceding transaction was sent to a new address instead of being returned to the main donation address. We made another transaction costing
                                a small network fee directly afterwards to return the change from <code class="language-javascript">pplgxva6cdkl9ye3par05yspm37jmjpv7vj569rw0a</code> back to the main address <code class="language-javascript">prnc2exht3zxlrqqcat690tc85cvfuypngh7szx6mk</code>

                            <p>2020-03-27: -0.03130073 BCH , another re-imbursement for a Chinese translation, this one for announcement of maintaining our own BCH specification (without the IFP parts) for the May 2020 upgrade</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>At the moment, most issues being raised are by contributors to the project who are finding things to fix, and need to track those items. As I remember, there were very few support requests from users (less than 5), and some of those
                        were raised and addressed on our Slack.</p>
                    <p>With regards to the project's previously announced plans, progress has been made on the following items:</p>

                                    as Bitcoin Core independently), which is used extensively by RPC calls.
                                    <br>It appear significant performance gains through optimization are possible, and some <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/merge_requests/122">early promising results</a> been achieved by a

                                        were not given room for discussion on the repository used in the past for these topics. Well, now we had to take action. The BCHN project has outlined the events and decisions that led to the creation of this separate
                                        set of specifications in our March 25 article entitled '<a href="https://read.cash/@bitcoincashnode/bchn-announcement-regarding-bitcoin-cash-bch-upgrade-specifications-c23d7d58">BCHN announcement regarding Bitcoin Cash (BCH) upgrade specifications</a>'.</p>

We are beginning to evaluate it (see Appendix B) and will store evaluation outputs in the <code class="language-javascript">output</code> section
                                    of that repository. After some more evaluation I will report some summary results which should be easier to digest. Just reading through the feedback has already been very useful to me in forming a mental picture of
                                    the issues that are most important to many users. As we did not receive much feedback from the Chinese community through this, I am considering to launch a separate survey targeted at that part of the Bitcoin Cash community
                                    in April, to see if we can get a clearer view of their needs.</li>

                                    project contributors. This is in response to community feedback that we should represent ourselves and our resumes a bit more personally. I'm looking forward to seeing more of our developers and testers on there soon!</li>

                        been reached to make Xversion palatable to BCHN and others, and that BU developer Greg Griffith is going to work on adapting a specification which will then serve as basis for common implementations.</p>

                    <p>In the process of confirming which projects were amenable to forming a security relationship with the "new kid on the block", BCHN, I reached out to multiple projects. The following projects confirmed and we have entered a mutual (reciprocal)
                        disclosure relationship:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bitcoin Unlimited</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>BCHD</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Flowee</p>
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>I believe we have a similar <em>informal</em> understanding at this time with Bitcoin Verde, but I still need to confirm that formally. Congratulations to Josh Green of Software Verde on the birth of his daughter, all the best from me
                        & our project.</p>
                    <p>Unfortuntely, the following projects did not respond at all to my explicit invitation to form a responsible disclosure relationship with us. I sent them invitation emails on 11 March 2020 to their official security addresses.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bitcoin ABC</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bitcoin Core</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>ZCash</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our figurative doors at BCHN remain open to any projects that are closely related (protocol wise) and would like to form a security relationship with Bitcoin Cash Node. Contact us at <code class="language-javascript">security at bitcoincashnode dot org</code> ,
                        or come visit us on our Slack and have a chat.</p>
                    <h3 id="coming-up">Coming up</h3>
                    <p>Our main focus in the next days will be on getting our fundraising campaign into gear, but in parallel I will push a minor roll-up patch release of our project. We are committed to a hard deadline of no later than 15 April, to give
                        at least a full month for users to install and test. Reminder: this will be a completely optional release - users already running BCHN do NOT have to upgrade again before 15 May unless they wish to run our latest software (which
                        we encourage, of course!)</p>

                    <p>The reported code sections were all in the third party libsecp256k1 library which is cryptographic code and likely takes special measures that static analyzers will find objectionable but which have good reasons for being the way they
                        are (e.g. to defend against timing attacks or making extra sure secret data does not leak).</p>
