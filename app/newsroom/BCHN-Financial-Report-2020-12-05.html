                    <p>Project funds are held by team members in a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet.</p>

                        and pay for project expenses (general funding of BCH Node operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting).</p>
                    <p>All our spending transactions are on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain except when we dispose of airdropped equity caused by fork coins which we convert into BCH.</p>

                    <h3 id="income">Income</h3>
                    <p>Currently BCHN derives its income mainly from donations.</p>
                    <p>The donations below include those made directly to our project donation address and those forwarded from tips on this site.</p>
                    <p>A total of 2388.85971266 BCH had been received in donations since the start of the project in February 2020. About half of that was raised via a Flipstarter campaign which <a href="https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/newsroom/bchn-flipstarted">successfully completed</a> on
                        26 April, yielding 978 BCH in funding for BCHN's initial <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/raw/master/finance/funding/campaigns/2020-q2-flipstarter/pdf/Bitcoin_Cash_Node_Flipstarter_Funding_Proposal_v1_1.pdf">project proposal</a>.
                        Another 1000 BCH was received in an anonymous donation in August 2020, and the remainder is from several business and personal donations.</p>
                    <p>There are many other anonymous donations making up the remainder, but some of our biggest known donors include ASICseer.com, Marc de Mesel and Georg Engelmann.</p>
                    <p>We thank everyone who has generously donated to us during the time since our last report.</p>
                    <h3 id="airdrop">Airdrop</h3>
                    <p>On November 15, 2020, Bitcoin ABC created a spin-off currency by forking away from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) currency.</p>
                    <p>The BCHN project received an amount of ABC's new coin equal to the amount of BCH held in our wallet at the time, and announced on November 18, 2020 that the ABC coin had been transferred to an exchange with intent to sell.</p>
                    <p>By November 19, 2020, the sale of approximately 2064 ABC coins had been executed, yielding just over 159.6 BCH which was transferred back to our wallet.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since then, the project holds virtually no more ABC coins except a minimal amount which has been received since due to replaying of regular donations made to our BCH wallet.</p>
                    <h3 id="expenses">Expenses</h3>
                    <p>Below are the project's expenses since the last overview on October 20, 2020. They amount to 93.18220457 BCH over that period. The mining fees have been excluded.</p>

                    <p>In the time since the last report, BCHN activity was focused on general development (with backporting activity reduced due to developer resource constraints).
                    </p>
                    <p>Two bounties were awarded in this period, one for test development and one for a responsible security disclosure.</p>
                    <p>4.16793533 BCH were spent on website maintenance and improvement.</p>
                    <p>64.4576615 BCH were spent on client software (and documentation) development.</p>
                    <p>9.07512626 BCH were spent on public relations, covering two monthly payments to our representative.</p>

                    <p>Prior to the November upgrade, a small amount in donations (0.00075823 BCH) was stored on a second address in our wallet (<code class="language-javascript">pp03e95qz7yene7v4vdx2vfsqx4qsq4wfvw8z3pkjf</code>). This adddress was issued
                        to Coin.dance who were collecting donations on behalf of node client projects.</p>
                    <p>As part of replay protection for its BCH transactions, the BCHN project has consolidated these funds back into the main wallet address after the recent BCH / BCHA split.</p>
                    <p>At the time of writing there are no funds on the secondary address, but this may change if Coin.dance collects and forwards any further funds to that address.

                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, the project has received and is holding donations of 2,000,000 SPICE 🌶️ and 1,000 USDt on that address.</p>
                    <p>A few other tokens have been sent to the address.</p>
                    <p>As we conduct our payments exclusively in Bitcoin Cash up to now, we have yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way, as
                        this would be a way to spam the project.</p>
