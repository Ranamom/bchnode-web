                    <p>Hello Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash Node user communities!</p>
                    <p>More than 2 weeks have passed since the initial release (v0.21.0) of Bitcoin Cash Node, and today I want to take some time to report back to you on what's happened since, and the activities we've been busy on and are working/planning
                        right now.</p>
                    <p>These reports will hopefully become a much more regular publication as things settle down a bit and we get our project processes up to speed.</p>
                    <h3 id="project-uptake">Project uptake</h3>
                    <p>Since release, at least 3 mining pools have mined blocks signaling support of Bitcoin Cash Node (and implying their disagreement with the IFP):</p>

                                        <br>Alexander has also helped to set up logging of public channels on our slack to <a href="http://logs.bchnode.org/"><a href="http://logs.bchnode.org/">http://logs.bchnode.org/</a></a>. We hope there will be further
                                        refinements to the logging, such as displaying from which channel a logged message originated - but this requires some vendor support ticket resolutions which we're waiting on.</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin Cash Node was approached by BU developer Greg Griffith with a request to implement the <code class="language-javascript">xversion</code> protocol message in BCHN.</p>
                    <p>There was healthy discussion both internally and on the Gitlab issue tracker (ref. <a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/45"><a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/45">https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bitcoin-cash-node/-/issues/45</a></a>)
                        and it seems BCHN developers are not opposed to the latest proposition to implement xversion based on a service bit. More technical discussion and refinement of an adapted specification is expected, but the process also led me
                        to formulate a rough set of guidelines for what BCHN needs from other clients who want to bring features across into it:</p>
                    <p><strong><u>BCHN Lead maintainer's general "requirements" for accepting merge requests from other implementations:</u></strong>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>(I have yet to formally describe these in our project documentation, and they are subject to review, but I'm listing here the common sense ones known at this time.)</em>
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p><code class="language-javascript">Conforming to our coding style which is basically identical to Bitcoin ABC still, but we have internally agreed on a soft line length limit of 80 and a hard one of 132 for the C/C++ code - the rest stays the same as ABC for now (Python code etc)</code>
                            </p>

                    <p>Bitcoin Cash Node was approached by Jonathan Toomim to discuss whether Xthinner and parts of the stress testing tooling developed for it, could be incorporated in BCHN.</p>
                    <p>The discussion and thinking about it (on BCHN side) is still in early phases, but interesting observations have been made by Jonathan with regard to the rather slow, but also good coin selection algorithm used in the node code, which
                        could be augmented by an alternative, faster but less optimal coin selector, useful in some situations (such as stress testing for bigger blocks).</p>
                    <p>Generally, I see a lot of potential for the cooperation between Bitcoin Cash Node and Jonathan on these features.</p>
                    <h3 id="state-of-bch-specification-repository-ifp-non-consensus">State of BCH specification repository & IFP (non-)consensus</h3>
                    <p>As some of you might be aware, I and other developers raised objections when the IFP proposal - roughly as previously described by Jiang Zhuoer and implemented by Bitcoin ABC - was merged into the "Bitcoin Cash organization"'s specification
                        folder in the bitcoincash.org repository on Github, against the expressed disagreement with the IFP by many in the Bitcoin Cash community.</p>
                    <p>Not only did the specification merge occur despite the protests, but also</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>against established convention not to merge extremely controversial consensus changes into what was supposed to be the commonly used repository for the regular hard-fork upgrade specifications</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Eighteen (18) days after the feature freeze of the specification!</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So I entered a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/453">Pull Request on Github to revert this IFP merger</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>The discussion was subsequently locked and closed</strong> by the maintainer(s), who refused to reveal themselves despite my repeated enquiries about who made these decisions.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I found out via automated email notification that my Github account (ftrader) had been removed from the Bitcoin Cash organization on 3 March, again by parties unknown and unwilling to acknowledge their responsibility.
                        I raised an <a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/issues/460">Issue on Github to ask about this</a>, which has been <strong>ignored for the last five (5) days now</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Two pull requests by our project team to add the Bitcoin Cash Node client to the list of full nodes on the bitcoincash.org website have also been refused on spurious grounds:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/450"><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/450">https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/450</a></a>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/459"><a href="https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/459">https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/pull/459</a></a>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This treatment of our project and the concerns of the community about the IFP by "the Bitcoin Cash organization" will encourage me and many of those who support Bitcoin Cash Node and are against the IFP and do not consider it as part
                        of the May 2020 upgrade, to seek alternatives when it comes to a home for the Bitcoin Cash protocol specification and information around compatible implementations for the upcoming May network upgrade.</p>
