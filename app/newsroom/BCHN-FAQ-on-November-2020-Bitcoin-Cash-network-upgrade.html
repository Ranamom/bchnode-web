                        <p>This is a FAQ specifically on BCHN's position regarding the November 2020 Bitcoin Cash network upgrade and related topics.</p>
                        <p>It is a document that is expected to incur some revision as we learn about new questions that the ecosystem may have. Please feel free to leave your questions in the comments.</p>

                        <h3 id="1-what-proposal-is-bchn-backing-for-november-if-any-">1. What proposal is BCHN backing for November, if any?</h3>
                        <p>BCHN backs the deployment of the aserti3-2d (<a href="https://read.cash/@jtoomim/bch-upgrade-proposal-use-asert-as-the-new-daa-8887b9c1">ASERT</a>) difficulty algorithm of Mark Lundeberg and Jonathan Toomim for the November upgrade.</p>
                        <h3 id="2-would-you-consider-a-no-upgrade-for-november-">2. Would you consider a "no-upgrade" for November?</h3>
                        <p>No, we do not support a "no upgrade" for November as we see the correction of the current DAA's problems as critical for the survival of Bitcoin Cash. The ASERT proposal has been evaluated against a wide range of contenders, including
                            the recently announced Grasberg proposal, and has demonstrably outperformed them.</p>
                        <h3 id="3-does-bchn-support-the-creation-of-a-new-coin-i-e-a-currency-split-">3. Does BCHN support the creation of a new coin (i.e. a currency split)?</h3>
                        <p>No. We support a unified Bitcoin Cash ecosystem moving forward on the basis of a well-researched, tested proposal that performs measurably better than the alternatives.</p>
                        <h3 id="4-is-bchn-going-to-abolish-automatic-replay-protection-aka-poison-pill-">4. Is BCHN going to abolish Automatic Replay Protection (aka poison pill)?</h3>
                        <p>The intent of "Automatic Replay Protection" is to avoid un-upgraded nodes causing problems after a planned upgrade. It causes un-upgraded nodes to fork themselves off to a new network at the time of an upgrade.</p>
                        <p>BCHN has a better way to accomplish the same intent by first ensuring that un-upgraded nodes notify the operator ahead of time, and second simply halting the un-upgraded node at the upgrade. Notification and shutdown are more actionable
                            and save the operator the wasted time and money of mining or accidentally transacting on an empty chain.</p>
                        <h3 id="5-has-anyone-asked-bchn-to-implement-historic-drift-correction-">5. Has anyone asked BCHN to implement historic drift correction?</h3>
                        <p>No. Despite being in contact with pools, exchanges and many other businesses that use and build on Bitcoin Cash, no-one has ever asked BCHN for this feature.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, the implications (longer block times & reduced mining reward) as recently considered by the ecosystem have shown strong and wide opposition to such a feature which negatively affects many users and would harm the reputation
                            of the network.</p>
