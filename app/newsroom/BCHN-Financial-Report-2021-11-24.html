                    <p>On November 15, 2020, Bitcoin ABC created a spin-off currency by forking away from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) currency.</p>
                    <p>This new coins is referred to as 'ABC' or 'bchabc' in our ledger files.</p>
                    <p>The BCHN project received an amount of ABC's coin equal to the amount of BCH held in our wallet at the time and entirely converted these (approx. 2064 ABC coins at the time) into around 159.6 BCH by November 19, 2020.</p>
                    <p>Since then, the project holds virtually no more ABC coins except a minimal amount which has been received since due to replaying of regular donations made to our BCH wallet (the 'donation_replay' income position).</p>
                    <p>If ABC coin donations reach a significant amount, the project may convert them to BCH in the future as it does not intend to hold them. At time of this report the ABC coin holdings amounted to less than 5 USD, the decrease from the
                        last report being due mostly to a price decrease of the ABC coin.</p>

                    <p>Currently, the project has received and is holding donations of 2,000,000 SPICE 🌶️ , 1,000 USDt and few other tokens have been sent to the address.</p>
                    <p>As we conduct our payments exclusively in Bitcoin Cash up to now, we have yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way, as
                        this would be a way to spam the project.</p>
