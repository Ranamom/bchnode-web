### Release announcement: Bitcoin Cash Node v24.0.0

The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project is pleased to announce its major release version 24.0.0.

This release implements the May 15, 2022 network upgrade.  It contains increased precision arithmetic operations, new VM operations including native introspection opcodes, the privacy-enhancing BIP69 (lexicographical sorting of wallet transaction inputs and outputs), and a number of bugfixes and performance improvements.

BCHN users should consider an update prior to May 15, 2022 as mandatory.  The v23.x.0 software will expire on May 15, and will start to warn of the need to update ahead of time, from April 15, 2022 onward.
