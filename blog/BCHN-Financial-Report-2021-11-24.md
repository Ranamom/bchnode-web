The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project practices and promotes transparent reporting.

Project funds are held by team members in a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet.

This wallet is used to receive [donations](https://bitcoincashnode.org/#donate) and pay for project expenses (general funding of BCH Node operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting).

All our transactions are on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

We use open source wallet software ([Electron Cash](https://www.electroncash.org/)) and maintain our accounts using [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) in a [ledger file](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/blob/master/finance/bookkeeping/bchn.journal) which is part of the public [project management repository](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public) on GitLab.

Based on this public ledger, the project can account for all its income and expenses and produce financial reports using auditable open source software.

Please refer to the Links section at the bottom for links to previous financial reports.

### Income

Currently BCHN derives its income mainly from donations.

The donations below include those made directly to our project donation
address and those forwarded from tips on this site.

A total of 0.69770558 BCH was received during this reporting period.
A neglibible amount of BCHA/ABC/XEC) was received as a result of
replayed BCH donation transactions.

A total of 4390.64103562 BCH had been received in donations since the start
of the project in February 2020. About 22% of that was raised via the original Flipstarter campaign which [successfully completed](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/newsroom/bchn-flipstarted) on 26 April 2020, yielding 978 BCH in funding for BCHN's initial [project proposal](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/raw/master/finance/funding/campaigns/2020-q2-flipstarter/pdf/Bitcoin_Cash_Node_Flipstarter_Funding_Proposal_v1_1.pdf).
1000 BCH was received in an anonymous donation in August 2020, another 1000 BCH in January 2021 and a 1000 BCH more in February 2021.
The remainder was received from several business and personal donations.

There are many other anonymous donations making up the remainder, but some
of our biggest known donors include ASICseer.com, Marc de Mesel and
Georg Engelmann.

We thank everyone who has generously donated to us during the time since
our last report.

### BCHA fork coin airdrop and policy

On November 15, 2020, Bitcoin ABC created a spin-off currency by forking
away from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) currency.

This new coins is referred to as 'ABC' or 'bchabc' in our ledger files.

The BCHN project received an amount of ABC's coin equal to the amount
of BCH held in our wallet at the time and entirely converted these (approx.
2064 ABC coins at the time) into around 159.6 BCH by November 19, 2020.

Since then, the project holds virtually no more ABC coins except a minimal
amount which has been received since due to replaying of regular donations
made to our BCH wallet (the 'donation_replay' income position).

If ABC coin donations reach a significant amount, the project may convert
them to BCH in the future as it does not intend to hold them.
At time of this report the ABC coin holdings amounted to less than 5 USD,
the decrease from the last report being due mostly to a price decrease
of the ABC coin.


### SLP donation address

The project has a SimpleLedger (SLP) token donation address.

    simpleledger:qrjv4klcn9z5kqeye3ps64pr6aa4mzux8cy776pm6k

Currently, the project has received and is holding donations of
2,000,000 SPICE üå∂Ô∏è , 1,000 USDt and few other tokens have been
sent to the address.

As we conduct our payments exclusively in Bitcoin Cash up to now, we have
yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for
main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way,
as this would be a way to spam the project.


### SmartBCH

The project does not, at this time, keep a SmartBCH wallet,
but is considering to create a multi-signature SmartBCH wallet for
those who want to donate sBCH or SEP20 tokens to us.

We will keep you informed of developments and post any related information,
such as a SmartBCH donation address, on the project website.
