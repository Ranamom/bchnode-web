The Bitcoin Cash Node (BCHN) project practices and promotes transparent reporting.

Project funds are held by team members in a 3-of-5 multi-signature wallet.

This wallet is used to receive [donations](https://bitcoincashnode.org/#donate) and pay for project expenses (general funding of BCH Node operations, including personnel, equipment and contracting).

All our transactions are on the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain.

We use open source wallet software ([Electron Cash](https://www.electroncash.org/)) and maintain our accounts using [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) in a [ledger file](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/blob/master/finance/bookkeeping/bchn.journal) which is part of the public [project management repository](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public) on GitLab.

Based on this public ledger, the project can account for all its income and expenses and produce financial reports using auditable open source software.

Please refer to the Links section at the bottom for links to previous financial reports.

### Income

Currently BCHN derives its income mainly from donations.

The donations below include those made directly to our project donation
address and those forwarded from tips on this site.

A total of 1200.52727624 BCH was received during this reporting period.
A neglibible amount of BCHA/ABC/XEC) was received as a result of
one replayed BCH donation transaction.

A total of 5591.16831186 BCH had been received in donations since the start
of the project in February 2020. About 17% of that was raised via the original Flipstarter campaign which [successfully completed](https://bitcoincashnode.org/en/newsroom/bchn-flipstarted) on 26 April 2020, yielding 978 BCH in funding for BCHN's initial [project proposal](https://gitlab.com/bitcoin-cash-node/bchn-project-management/bchn-pm-public/-/raw/master/finance/funding/campaigns/2020-q2-flipstarter/pdf/Bitcoin_Cash_Node_Flipstarter_Funding_Proposal_v1_1.pdf).
Thereafter some big anonymous donations have been received:

* 1000 BCH in August 2020

* 1000 BCH in January 2021

* 1000 BCH in February 2021

* 1000 BCH in November 2021

*  200 BCH in May 2022

The remainder was received from several business and personal donations.
Some of our biggest known donors include ASICseer.com, Marc de Mesel,

In the time since the last report, BCHN activity was directed towards:

* bug fixing

* optimization

* improvement of tests and benchmarks

* code cleanup

* general backports

* upgrade to TORv3 / BIP155 implementation

* technical investigations and reports on various node client
  software architectures (work in progress)

* review and draft implementation of CHIPs

* user support

No bounties were awarded in this period, but a bounty process is
in development.

27.69438705 BCH were spent on public relations, covering seven monthly
payments to our representative.

477.55598372 BCH were spent on client software development and maintenance.

5.28202638 BCH were spent on website maintenance and content.

91.93541447 BCH were spent on an external contract with Software Verde
to conduct scaling tests with various software infrastructure components.
This is an ongoing contract running from 1 April 2022 for a total of 640 hours,
with a nominal end date of 31 August. It is categorised as 'external' in
the above expenses. Software Verde reports progress on this work on the
Bitcoin Cash Research site.

The 5.1 BCH spent on “marketing” was for a HackSmart flipstarter pledge which
was refunded when the flipstarter was canceled due to volatility.
Thus it was effectively not an expense in the end, but shows up as an expense
in this report (there is a corresponding "refund" transaction as income from
the cancellation in the ledger. We only incurred minor network transfer fees
for this marketing operation).

### BCHA fork coin airdrop and policy

On November 15, 2020, Bitcoin ABC created a spin-off currency by forking
away from the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) currency.

This new coins is referred to as 'ABC' or 'bchabc' in our ledger files.
It is now traded under the symbol XEC and branded as "eCash" on most
exchanges / explorers.

The BCHN project received an amount of ABC's coin equal to the amount
of BCH held in our wallet at the time and entirely converted these (approx.
2064 ABC coins at the time) into around 159.6 BCH by November 19, 2020.

Since then, the project holds virtually no more ABC coins except a minimal
amount which has been received since due to replaying of regular donations
made to our BCH wallet (the 'donation_replay' income position).

If ABC coin donations reach a significant amount, the project may convert
them to BCH in the future as it does not intend to hold them.
At time of this report the ABC coin holdings amounted to less than 8 USD,
the increase from the last report being due mostly to an additional replayed
transaction and price fluctuation of the ABC coin.

### SLP donation address

The project has a SimpleLedger (SLP) token donation address.

    simpleledger:qrjv4klcn9z5kqeye3ps64pr6aa4mzux8cy776pm6k

Currently, the project has received and is holding donations of
2,000,000 SPICE 🌶️ , 1,000 USDt and few other tokens have been
sent to the address.

As we conduct our payments exclusively in Bitcoin Cash up to now, we have
yet to set up a ledger file to account for token holdings. We may do so for
main tokens like SPICE, but not generally for all random tokens sent our way,
as this would be a way to spam the project.


### SmartBCH

The project does not, at this time, keep a SmartBCH wallet,
but is considering to create a multi-signature SmartBCH wallet for
those who want to donate sBCH or SEP20 tokens to us.

We will keep you informed of developments and post any related information,
such as a SmartBCH donation address, on the project website.
